# AI-Research-Project

The goal of this project was to use the necessary attributes found in a provided dataset and create a regression module. With the help of PyCaret, I was able to create a supervised machine learning regression module which is used for predicting continuous values / outcomes using various techniques and algorithms. In this case, I was predicting the count (cnt) value from my database. When comparing all models using the compare_models() pycarat tool, i found that for my dataset, Light gradient boosting machine was going to be the best model for my performance. Light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) is a framework and a variant of gradient boosting. Like another gradient boosting Light GBM is also based on Decision tree algorithms. Using the LGBM framework, I was able to predict the count column to a 96% accuracy.
